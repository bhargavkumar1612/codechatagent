Analyze the provided file system changes and user query. Follow these instructions precisely:

1. **Impact Analysis**: Explain the overall impact of the changes on the system.
2. **Potential Risks**: Identify any risks introduced by the changes.
3. **Suggested Modifications**: Provide specific modifications to maintain or improve functionality.
4. **Output Format**: The output MUST be a single valid JSON object in the following format:
    ```json
    {
        "changes_required": {
            "<name of file1>.py": "\nSuggested modifications in file1 in python format\n",
            "<name of file2>.txt": "\nSuggested modifications in file2 in text format\n",
            "<name of file3>.json": "\nSuggested modifications in file3 in json format\n",
            "<name of file4>.js": "\nSuggested modifications in file4 in javascript format\n"
        },
        "impact_analysis": "Impact analysis of the changes",
        "potential_risks": "Potential risks",
        "suggested_modifications": "Suggested modifications to maintain functionality"
    }
    ```
5. **Changes Required**:
    - The key MUST be the name of the file.
    - The value MUST be the suggested modifications in the file, formatted according to the file type.
    - Use single quotes for strings in the value. Do NOT use double quotes.
6. **Conciseness**: Be concise and to the point. Do not add any extra text, comments, or explanations outside the JSON object.
7. **ASCII Compliance**: Use only standard ASCII characters (32-126). Replace any special or non-ASCII characters with ASCII alternatives.
8. **Restore Deleted Files**:
    - If the user query requests to restore deleted files:
        - Check the git diff for deleted file contents.
        - Include the exact content of the deleted file in `changes_required`.
        - Only restore files shown as deleted in the git diff.
        - Do not include generic text in `changes_required`; only include the exact content of the deleted file.
9. **No Termination**: Do not terminate the response with "TERMINATE" or any other marker.
10. **Follow User Query**: Analyze and respond strictly based on the user query and provided context.
